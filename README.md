# Module 4: Disaster Visualization Program

This Python program visualizes global fire and earthquake data using Plotly. It retrieves fire data from a NASA CSV and earthquake data from the USGS API, creating interactive scattergeo plots.

## Features
- Modular design with separate functions for data fetching and plotting.
- User-friendly menu to select visualization type.
- Robust error handling and data validation.
- Ethical data sourcing with proper attribution.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `requests`, `csv`, `json`, `plotly`

## Usage
Run `disaster_visualization.py` and follow the prompts to visualize fire or earthquake data.

## Ethical Note
Data is sourced from public NASA and USGS repositories. No proprietary data is used, ensuring compliance with copyright standards.
